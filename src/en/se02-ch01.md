# Objects Everywhere

> Objects store data using *properties* (`val`s and `var`s) and perform operations with this data using functions.

Some definitions:

- *Class*: Defines properties and functions for what is essentially a new data type. Classes are also called *user-defined types*.
- *Member*: Either a property or a function of a class.
- *Member function*: A function that works only with a specific class of object.
- *Creating an object*: Making a `val` or `var` of a class. Also called *creating an instance* of that class.

Because classes define *state* and *behavior*, we can even refer to instances of built-in types like `Double` or `Boolean` as objects.

Consider Kotlin’s `IntRange` class:

```
// ObjectsEverywhere/IntRanges.kt

fun main() {
  val r1 = IntRange(0, 10)
  val r2 = IntRange(5, 7)
  println(r1)
  println(r2)
}
/* Output:
0..10
5..7
*/
```

We create two objects (instances) of the `IntRange` *class*. Each object has its own piece of storage in memory. `IntRange` is a class, but a particular range `r1` from 0 to 10 is an object that is distinct from range `r2`.

Numerous operations are available for an `IntRange` object. Some are straightforward, like `sum()`, and others require more understanding before you can use them. If you try calling one that needs arguments, the IDE will ask for those arguments.

To learn about a particular member function, look it up in the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/index.html). Notice the magnifying glass icon in the top right area of the page. Click on that and type `IntRange` into the search box. Click on `kotlin.ranges > IntRange` from the resulting search. You’ll see the documentation for the `IntRange` class. You can study all the member functions—the *Application Programming Interface* (API)—of the class. Although you won’t understand most of it at this time, it’s helpful to become comfortable looking things up in the Kotlin documentation.

An `IntRange` is a kind of object, and a defining characteristic of an object is that you perform operations on it. Instead of “performing an operation,” we say *calling a member function*. To call a member function for an object, start with the object identifier, then a dot, then the name of the operation:

```
// ObjectsEverywhere/RangeSum.kt

fun main() {
  val r = IntRange(0, 10)
  println(r.sum())
}
/* Output:
55
*/
```

Because `sum()` is a member function defined for `IntRange`, you call it by saying `r.sum()`. This adds up all the numbers in that `IntRange`.

Earlier object-oriented languages used the phrase “sending a message” to describe calling a member function for an object. Sometimes you’ll still see that terminology.

Classes can have many operations (member functions). It’s easy to explore classes using an IDE (integrated development environment) that includes a feature called *code completion*. For example, if you type `.s` after an object identifier within IntelliJ IDEA, it shows all the members of that object that begin with `s`:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/code-completion.png" alt="code completion" style="zoom:60%;" />
  <p>Code Completion</p>
</div>

Try using code completion on other objects. For example, you can reverse a `String` or convert all the characters to lower case:

```
// ObjectsEverywhere/Strings.kt

fun main() {
  val s = "AbcD"
  println(s.reversed())
  println(s.toLowerCase())
}
/* Output:
DcbA
abcd
*/
```

You can easily convert a `String` to an integer and back:

```
// ObjectsEverywhere/Conversion.kt

fun main() {
  val s = "123"
  println(s.toInt())
  val i = 123
  println(i.toString())
}
/* Output:
123
123
*/
```

Later in the book we discuss strategies to handle situations when the `String` you want to convert doesn’t represent a correct integer value.

You can also convert from one numerical type to another. To avoid confusion, conversions between number types are explicit. For example, you convert an `Int i` to a `Long` by calling `i.toLong()`, or to a `Double` with `i.toDouble()`:

```
// ObjectsEverywhere/NumberConversions.kt

fun fraction(numerator: Long, denom: Long) =
  numerator.toDouble() / denom

fun main() {
  val num = 1
  val den = 2
  val f = fraction(num.toLong(), den.toLong())
  println(f)
}
/* Output:
0.5
*/
```

Well-defined classes are easy for a programmer to understand, and produce code that’s easy to read.
