# `when` Expressions

> A large part of computer programming is performing an action when a pattern matches.

Anything that simplifies this task is a boon for programmers. If you have more than two or three choices to make, *when expressions* are much nicer than [`if` expressions](javascript:void(0)).

A `when` expression compares a value against a selection of possibilities. It begins with the keyword `when` and the parenthesized value to compare. This is followed by a body containing a set of possible matches and their associated actions. Each match is an expression followed by a right arrow `->`. The arrow is the two separate characters `-` and `>` with no white space between them. The expression is evaluated and compared to the target value. If it matches, the expression to the right of the `->` produces the result of the `when` expression.

`ordinal()` in the following example builds the German word for an ordinal number based on a word for the cardinal number. It matches an integer to a fixed set of numbers to check whether it applies to a general rule or is an exception (which happens painfully often in German):

```
// WhenExpressions/GermanOrdinals.kt
package whenexpressions
import atomictest.eq

val numbers = mapOf(
  1 to "eins", 2 to "zwei", 3 to "drei",
  4 to "vier", 5 to "fuenf", 6 to "sechs",
  7 to "sieben", 8 to "acht", 9 to "neun",
  10 to "zehn", 11 to "elf", 12 to "zwoelf",
  13 to "dreizehn", 14 to "vierzehn",
  15 to "fuenfzehn", 16 to "sechzehn",
  17 to "siebzehn", 18 to "achtzehn",
  19 to "neunzehn", 20 to "zwanzig"
)

fun ordinal(i: Int): String =
  when (i) {                            // [1]
    1 -> "erste"                        // [2]
    3 -> "dritte"
    7 -> "siebte"
    8 -> "achte"
    20 -> "zwanzigste"
    else -> numbers.getValue(i) + "te"  // [3]
  }

fun main() {
  ordinal(2) eq "zweite"
  ordinal(3) eq "dritte"
  ordinal(11) eq "elfte"
}
```

- **[1]** The `when` expression compares `i` to the match expressions in the body.
- **[2]** The first successful match completes execution of the `when` expression—here, a `String` is produced which becomes the return value of `ordinal()`.
- **[3]** The `else` keyword provides a “fall through” when there are no matches. The `else` case always appears last in the match list. When we test against `2`, it doesn’t match 1, 3, 7, 8 or 20, and so falls through to the `else` case.

If you forget the `else` branch in the example above, the compile-time error is: *‘when’ expression must be exhaustive, add necessary ‘else’ branch*. If you treat a `when` expression as a statement—that is, you don’t use the result of the `when`—you can omit the `else` branch. Unmatched values are then just ignored.

In the following example, `Coordinates` reports changes to its properties using [Property Accessors](javascript:void(0)). The `when` expression processes each item from `inputs`:

```
// WhenExpressions/AnalyzeInput.kt
package whenexpressions
import atomictest.*

class Coordinates {
  var x: Int = 0
    set(value) {
      trace("x gets $value")
      field = value
    }
  var y: Int = 0
    set(value) {
      trace("y gets $value")
      field = value
    }
  override fun toString() = "($x, $y)"
}

fun processInputs(inputs: List<String>) {
  val coordinates = Coordinates()
  for (input in inputs) {
    when (input) {                   // [1]
      "up", "u" -> coordinates.y--   // [2]
      "down", "d" -> coordinates.y++
      "left", "l" -> coordinates.x--
      "right", "r" -> {              // [3]
        trace("Moving right")
        coordinates.x++
      }
      "nowhere" -> {}                // [4]
      "exit" -> return               // [5]
      else -> trace("bad input: $input")
    }
  }
}

fun main() {
  processInputs(listOf("up", "d", "nowhere",
    "left",  "right", "exit", "r"))
  trace eq """
    y gets -1
    y gets 0
    x gets -1
    Moving right
    x gets 0
  """
}
```

- **[1]** `input` is matched against the different options.
- **[2]** You can list several values in one branch using commas. Here, if the user enters either “up” or “u” we interpret it as a move up.
- **[3]** Multiple actions within a branch must be in a block body.
- **[4]** “Doing nothing” is expressed with an empty block.
- **[5]** Returning from the outer function is a valid action within a branch. In this case, the `return` terminates the call to `processInputs()`.

Any expression can be an argument for `when`, and the matches can be any values (not just constants):

```
// WhenExpressions/MatchingAgainstVals.kt
import atomictest.*

fun main() {
  val yes = "A"
  val no = "B"
  for (choice in listOf(yes, no, yes)) {
    when (choice) {
      yes -> trace("Hooray!")
      no -> trace("Too bad!")
    }
    // The same logic using 'if':
    if (choice == yes) trace("Hooray!")
    else if (choice == no) trace("Too bad!")
  }
  trace eq """
    Hooray!
    Hooray!
    Too bad!
    Too bad!
    Hooray!
    Hooray!
  """
}
```

`when` expressions can overlap the functionality of `if` expressions. `when` is more flexible, so prefer it over `if` when there’s a choice.

We can match a `Set` of values against another `Set` of values:

```
// WhenExpressions/MixColors.kt
package whenexpressions
import atomictest.eq

fun mixColors(first: String, second: String) =
  when (setOf(first, second)) {
    setOf("red", "blue") -> "purple"
    setOf("red", "yellow") -> "orange"
    setOf("blue", "yellow") -> "green"
    else -> "unknown"
  }

fun main() {
  mixColors("red", "blue") eq "purple"
  mixColors("blue", "red") eq "purple"
  mixColors("blue", "purple") eq "unknown"
}
```

Inside `mixColors()` we use a `Set` as a `when` argument and compare it with different `Set`s. We use a `Set` because the order of elements is unimportant—we need the same result when we mix “red” and “blue” as when we mix “blue” and “red.”

`when` has a special form that takes no argument. Omitting the argument means the branches can check different `Boolean` conditions. You can use any Boolean expression as a branch condition. As an example, we rewrite `bmiMetric()` introduced in [Number Types](javascript:void(0)), first showing the original solution, then using `when` instead of `if`:

```
// WhenExpressions/BmiWhen.kt
package whenexpressions
import atomictest.eq

fun bmiMetricOld(
  kg: Double,
  heightM: Double
): String {
  val bmi = kg / (heightM * heightM)
  return if (bmi < 18.5) "Underweight"
    else if (bmi < 25) "Normal weight"
    else "Overweight"
}

fun bmiMetricWithWhen(
  kg: Double,
  heightM: Double
): String {
  val bmi = kg / (heightM * heightM)
  return when {
    bmi < 18.5 -> "Underweight"
    bmi < 25 -> "Normal weight"
    else -> "Overweight"
  }
}

fun main() {
  bmiMetricOld(72.57, 1.727) eq
    bmiMetricWithWhen(72.57, 1.727)
}
```

The solution using `when` is a more elegant way to choose between several options.
