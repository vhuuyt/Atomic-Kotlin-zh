# Folding Lists

> `fold()` combines all elements of a list, in order, to generate a single result.

A common exercise is to implement operations such as `sum()` or `reverse()` using `fold()`. Here, `fold()` sums a sequence:

```
// FoldingLists/SumViaFold.kt
import atomictest.eq

fun main() {
  val list = listOf(1, 10, 100, 1000)
  list.fold(0) { sum, n ->
    sum + n
  } eq 1111
}
```

`fold()` takes the initial value (its argument, `0` in this case) and successively applies the operation (expressed here as a lambda) to combine the current accumulated value with each element. `fold()` first adds `0` (the initial value) and `1` to get `1`. That becomes the `sum`, which is then added to the `10` to get `11`, which becomes the new `sum`. The operation is repeated for two more elements: `100` and `1000`. This produces `111` and `1111`. The `fold()` will stop when there is nothing else in the list, returning the final `sum` of `1111`. Of course, `fold()` doesn’t really know it’s doing a “sum”—the choice of identifier name was ours, to make it easier to understand.

To illuminate the steps in a `fold()`, here’s `SumViaFold.kt` using an ordinary `for` loop:

```
// FoldingLists/FoldVsForLoop.kt
import atomictest.eq

fun main() {
  val list = listOf(1, 10, 100, 1000)
  var accumulator = 0
  val operation =
    { sum: Int, i: Int -> sum + i }
  for (i in list) {
    accumulator = operation(accumulator, i)
  }
  accumulator eq 1111
}
```

`fold()` accumulates values by successively applying `operation` to combine the current element with the accumulator value.

Although `fold()` is an important concept and the only way to accumulate values in pure functional languages, you may sometimes still use an ordinary `for` loop in Kotlin.

`foldRight()` processes elements starting from right to left, as opposed to `fold()` which processes the elements from left to right. This example demonstrates the difference:

```
// FoldingLists/FoldRight.kt
import atomictest.eq

fun main() {
  val list = listOf('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
  list.fold("*") { acc, elem ->
    "($acc) + $elem"
  } eq "((((*) + a) + b) + c) + d"
  list.foldRight("*") { elem, acc ->
    "$elem + ($acc)"
  } eq "a + (b + (c + (d + (*))))"
}
```

`fold()` first applies the operation to `a`, as we can see in `(*) + a`, while `foldRight()` first processes the right-hand element `d`, and processes `a` last.

`fold()` and `foldRight()` take an explicit accumulator value as the first argument. Sometimes the first element can act as an initial value. `reduce()` and `reduceRight()` behave like `fold()` and `foldRight()` but use the first and last element, respectively, as the initial value:

```
// FoldingLists/ReduceAndReduceRight.kt
import atomictest.eq

fun main() {
  val chars = "A B C D E F G H I".split(" ")
  chars.fold("X") { a, e -> "$a $e"} eq
    "X A B C D E F G H I"
  chars.foldRight("X") { a, e -> "$a $e" } eq
    "A B C D E F G H I X"
  chars.reduce { a, e -> "$a $e" } eq
    "A B C D E F G H I"
  chars.reduceRight { a, e -> "$a $e" } eq
    "A B C D E F G H I"
}
```

`runningFold()` and `runningReduce()` produce a `List` containing all the intermediate steps of the process. The final value in the `List` is the result of the `fold()` or `reduce()`:

```
// FoldingLists/RunningFold.kt
import atomictest.eq

fun main() {
  val list = listOf(11, 13, 17, 19)
  list.fold(7) { sum, n ->
    sum + n
  } eq 67
  list.runningFold(7) { sum, n ->
    sum + n
  } eq "[7, 18, 31, 48, 67]"
  list.reduce { sum, n ->
    sum + n
  } eq 60
  list.runningReduce { sum, n ->
    sum + n
  } eq "[11, 24, 41, 60]"
}
```

`runningFold()` first stores the initial value (`7`), then stores each intermediate result. `runningReduce()` keeps track of each `sum` value.
