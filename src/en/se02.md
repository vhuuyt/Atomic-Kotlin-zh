# Section II: Introduction to Objects

> *Objects* are the foundation for numerous modern languages, including Kotlin.

In an *object-oriented* (OO) programming language, you discover “nouns” in the problem you’re solving, and translate those nouns to objects. Objects hold data and perform actions. An object-oriented language creates and uses objects.

Kotlin isn’t just object-oriented; it’s also *functional*. Functional languages focus on the actions you perform (“verbs”). Kotlin is a hybrid object-functional language.
