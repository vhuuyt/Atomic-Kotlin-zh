# Safe Calls & the Elvis Operator

> Kotlin provides convenient operations for handling nullability.

Nullable types come with numerous restrictions. You can’t simply dereference an identifier of a nullable type:

```
// SafeCallsAndElvis/DereferenceNull.kt

fun main() {
  val s: String? = null
  // Doesn't compile:
  // s.length        // [1]
}
```

Uncommenting **[1]** produces a compile-time error: *Only safe (`?.`) or non-null asserted (`!!.`) calls are allowed on a nullable receiver of type `String?`.*

A *safe call* replaces the dot (`.`) in a regular call with a question mark and a dot (`?.`), without intervening space. Safe calls access members of a nullable in a way that ensures no exceptions are thrown. They only perform an operation when the receiver is not `null`:

```
// SafeCallsAndElvis/SafeOperation.kt
package safecalls
import atomictest.*

fun String.echo() {
  trace(toUpperCase())
  trace(this)
  trace(toLowerCase())
}

fun main() {
  val s1: String? = "Howdy!"
  s1?.echo()                  // [1]
  val s2: String? = null
  s2?.echo()                  // [2]
  trace eq """
    HOWDY!
    Howdy!
    howdy!
  """
}
```

Line **[1]** calls `echo()` and produces results in the `trace`, while line **[2]** does nothing because the receiver `s2` is `null`.

Safe calls are a clean way to capture results:

```
// SafeCallsAndElvis/SafeCall.kt
package safecalls
import atomictest.eq

fun checkLength(s: String?, expected: Int?) {
  val length1 =
    if (s != null) s.length else null  // [1]
  val length2 = s?.length              // [2]
  length1 eq expected
  length2 eq expected
}

fun main() {
  checkLength("abc", 3)
  checkLength(null, null)
}
```

Line **[2]** achieves the same effect as line **[1]**. If the receiver is not `null` it performs a normal access (`s.length`). If the receiver is `null` it doesn’t perform the `s.length` call (which would cause an exception), but produces `null` for the expression.

What if you need something more than the `null` produced by `?.`? The *Elvis operator* provides an alternative. This operator is a question mark followed by a colon (`?:`), with no intervening space. It is named for an emoticon of the musician Elvis Presley, and is also a play on the words “else-if” (which sounds vaguely like “Elvis”).

A number of programming languages provide a *null coalescing operator* that performs the same action as Kotlin’s Elvis operator.

If the expression on the left of `?:` is not `null`, that expression becomes the result. If the left-hand expression *is* `null`, then the expression on the right of the `?:` becomes the result:

```
// SafeCallsAndElvis/ElvisOperator.kt
import atomictest.eq

fun main() {
  val s1: String? = "abc"
  (s1 ?: "---") eq "abc"

  val s2: String? = null
  (s2 ?: "---") eq "---"
}
```

`s1` is not `null`, so the Elvis operator produces `"abc"` as the result. Because `s2` is `null`, the Elvis operator produces the alternate result of `"---"`.

The Elvis operator is typically used after a safe call, to produce a meaningful value instead of the default `null`, as you see in **[2]**:

```
// SafeCallsAndElvis/ElvisCall.kt
package safecalls
import atomictest.eq

fun checkLength(s: String?, expected: Int) {
  val length1 =
    if (s != null) s.length else 0    // [1]
  val length2 = s?.length ?: 0        // [2]
  length1 eq expected
  length2 eq expected
}

fun main() {
  checkLength("abc", 3)
  checkLength(null, 0)
}
```

This `checkLength()` function is quite similar to the one in `SafeCall.kt` above. The `expected` parameter type is now non-nullable. **[1]** and **[2]** produce zero instead of `null`.

Safe calls allow you to write chained calls concisely, when some elements in the chain might be `null` and you’re only interested in the final result:

```
// SafeCallsAndElvis/ChainedCalls.kt
package safecalls
import atomictest.eq

class Person(
  val name: String,
  var friend: Person? = null
)

fun main() {
  val alice = Person("Alice")
  alice.friend?.friend?.name eq null   // [1]

  val bob = Person("Bob")
  val charlie = Person("Charlie", bob)
  bob.friend = charlie
  bob.friend?.friend?.name eq "Bob"    // [2]

  (alice.friend?.friend?.name
    ?: "Unknown") eq "Unknown"         // [3]
}
```

When you chain access to several members using safe calls, the result is `null` if any intermediate expressions are `null`.

- **[1]** The property `alice.friend` is `null`, so the rest of the calls return  `null`.
- **[2]** All intermediate calls produce meaningful values.
- **[3]** An Elvis operator after the chain of safe calls provides an alternate value if any intermediate element is `null`.
