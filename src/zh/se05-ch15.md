# Nested Classes

> Nested classes enable more refined structures within your objects.

A nested class is simply a class within the namespace of the outer class. The implication is that the outer class “owns” the nested class. This feature is not essential, but nesting a class can clarify your code. Here, `Plane` is nested within `Airport`:

```
// NestedClasses/Airport.kt
package nestedclasses
import atomictest.eq
import nestedclasses.Airport.Plane

class Airport(private val code: String) {
  open class Plane {
    // Can access private properties:
    fun contact(airport: Airport) =
      "Contacting ${airport.code}"
  }
  private class PrivatePlane : Plane()
  fun privatePlane(): Plane = PrivatePlane()
}

fun main() {
  val denver = Airport("DEN")
  var plane = Plane()                   // [1]
  plane.contact(denver) eq "Contacting DEN"
  // Can't do this:
  // val privatePlane = Airport.PrivatePlane()
  val frankfurt = Airport("FRA")
  plane = frankfurt.privatePlane()
  // Can't do this:
  // val p = plane as PrivatePlane      // [2]
  plane.contact(frankfurt) eq "Contacting FRA"
}
```

In `contact()`, the nested class `Plane` has access to the `private` property `code` in the `airport` argument, whereas an ordinary class would not have this access. Other than that, `Plane` is simply a class inside the `Airport` namespace.

Creating a `Plane` object does not require an `Airport` object, but if you create it outside the `Airport` class body, you must ordinarily qualify the constructor call in **[1]**. By importing `nestedclasses.Airport.Plane` we avoid this qualification.

A nested class can be `private`, as with `PrivatePlane`. Making it `private` means that `PrivatePlane` is completely invisible outside the body of `Airport`, so you cannot call the `PrivatePlane` constructor outside of `Airport`. If you define and return a `PrivatePlane` from a member function, as seen in `privatePlane()`, the result must be upcast to a `public` type (assuming it extends a `public` type), and cannot be downcast to the `private` type, as seen in **[2]**.

Here’s an example of nesting where `Cleanable` is a base class for both the enclosing class `House` and all the nested classes. `clean()` goes through a `List` of `parts` and calls `clean()` for each one, producing a kind of recursion:

```
// NestedClasses/NestedHouse.kt
package nestedclasses
import atomictest.*

abstract class Cleanable(val id: String) {
  open val parts: List<Cleanable> = listOf()
  fun clean(): String {
    val text = "$id clean"
    if (parts.isEmpty()) return text
    return "${parts.joinToString(
      " ", "(", ")",
      transform = Cleanable::clean)} $text\n"
  }
}

class House : Cleanable("House") {
  override val parts = listOf(
    Bedroom("Master Bedroom"),
    Bedroom("Guest Bedroom")
  )
  class Bedroom(id: String) : Cleanable(id) {
    override val parts =
      listOf(Closet(), Bathroom())
    class Closet : Cleanable("Closet") {
      override val parts =
        listOf(Shelf(), Shelf())
      class Shelf : Cleanable("Shelf")
    }
    class Bathroom : Cleanable("Bathroom") {
      override val parts =
        listOf(Toilet(), Sink())
      class Toilet : Cleanable("Toilet")
      class Sink : Cleanable("Sink")
    }
  }
}

fun main() {
  House().clean() eq """
  (((Shelf clean Shelf clean) Closet clean
   (Toilet clean Sink clean) Bathroom clean
  ) Master Bedroom clean
   ((Shelf clean Shelf clean) Closet clean
   (Toilet clean Sink clean) Bathroom clean
  ) Guest Bedroom clean
  ) House clean
  """
}
```

Notice the multiple levels of nesting. For example, `Bedroom` contains `Bathroom` which contains `Toilet` and `Sink`.

### Local Classes

Classes that are nested inside functions are called *local* classes:

```
// NestedClasses/LocalClasses.kt
package nestedclasses

fun localClasses() {
  open class Amphibian
  class Frog : Amphibian()
  val amphibian: Amphibian = Frog()
}
```

`Amphibian` looks like a candidate to be an `interface` rather than an `open class`. However, local interfaces are not allowed.

Local `open` classes should be rare; if you need one, what you’re trying to make is probably significant enough to create a regular class.

`Amphibian` and `Frog` are invisible outside `localClasses()`, so you can’t return them from the function. To return objects of local classes, you must upcast them to a class or interface defined *outside* the function:

```
// NestedClasses/ReturnLocal.kt
package nestedclasses

interface Amphibian

fun createAmphibian(): Amphibian {
  class Frog : Amphibian
  return Frog()
}

fun main() {
  val amphibian = createAmphibian()
  // amphibian as Frog
}
```

`Frog` is still invisible outside `createAmphibian()`—in `main()`, you cannot cast `amphibian` to a `Frog` because `Frog` isn’t available, so Kotlin reports the attempt to use `Frog` as an “unresolved reference.”

### Classes Inside Interfaces

Classes can be nested within interfaces:

```
// NestedClasses/WithinInterface.kt
package nestedclasses
import atomictest.eq

interface Item {
  val type: Type
  data class Type(val type: String)
}

class Bolt(type: String) : Item {
  override val type = Item.Type(type)
}

fun main() {
  val items = listOf(
    Bolt("Slotted"), Bolt("Hex")
  )
  items.map(Item::type) eq
    "[Type(type=Slotted), Type(type=Hex)]"
}
```

In `Bolt`, the `val type` must be overridden and assigned using the qualified class name `Item.Type`.

### Nested Enumerations

Enumerations are classes, so they can be nested inside other classes:

```
// NestedClasses/Ticket.kt
package nestedclasses
import atomictest.eq
import nestedclasses.Ticket.Seat.*

class Ticket(
  val name: String,
  val seat: Seat = Coach
) {
  enum class Seat {
    Coach,
    Premium,
    Business,
    First
  }
  fun upgrade(): Ticket {
    val newSeat = values()[
      (seat.ordinal + 1)
      .coerceAtMost(First.ordinal)
    ]
    return Ticket(name, newSeat)
  }
  fun meal() = when(seat) {
    Coach -> "Bag Meal"
    Premium -> "Bag Meal with Cookie"
    Business -> "Hot Meal"
    First -> "Private Chef"
  }
  override fun toString() = "$seat"
}

fun main() {
  val tickets = listOf(
    Ticket("Jerry"),
    Ticket("Summer", Premium),
    Ticket("Squanchy", Business),
    Ticket("Beth", First)
  )
  tickets.map(Ticket::meal) eq
    "[Bag Meal, Bag Meal with Cookie, " +
    "Hot Meal, Private Chef]"
  tickets.map(Ticket::upgrade) eq
    "[Premium, Business, First, First]"
  tickets eq
    "[Coach, Premium, Business, First]"
  tickets.map(Ticket::meal) eq
    "[Bag Meal, Bag Meal with Cookie, " +
    "Hot Meal, Private Chef]"
}
```

`upgrade()` adds one to the `ordinal` value of the `seat`, then uses the library function `coerceAtMost()` to ensure the new value does not exceed `First.ordinal` before indexing into `values()` to produce the new `Seat` type. Following functional programming principles, upgrading a `Ticket` produces a new `Ticket` rather than modifying the old one.

`meal()` uses `when` to test every type of `Seat` and this suggests we could use polymorphism instead.

Enumerations cannot be nested within functions, and cannot inherit from other classes (including other enumerations).

Interfaces can contain nested enumerations. `FillIt` is a game-like simulation that fills a square grid with randomly-chosen `X` and `O` marks:

```
// NestedClasses/FillIt.kt
package nestedclasses
import nestedclasses.Game.State.*
import nestedclasses.Game.Mark.*
import kotlin.random.Random
import atomictest.*

interface Game {
  enum class State { Playing, Finished }
  enum class Mark { Blank, X ,O }
}

class FillIt(
  val side: Int = 3, randomSeed: Int = 0
): Game {
  val rand = Random(randomSeed)
  private var state = Playing
  private val grid =
    MutableList(side * side) { Blank }
  private var player = X
  fun turn() {
    val blanks = grid.withIndex()
      .filter { it.value == Blank }
    if(blanks.isEmpty()) {
      state = Finished
    } else {
      grid[blanks.random(rand).index] = player
      player = if (player == X) O else X
    }
  }
  fun play() {
    while(state != Finished)
      turn()
  }
  override fun toString() =
    grid.chunked(side).joinToString("\n")
}

fun main() {
  val game = FillIt(8, 17)
  game.play()
  game eq """
  [O, X, O, X, O, X, X, X]
  [X, O, O, O, O, O, X, X]
  [O, O, X, O, O, O, X, X]
  [X, O, O, O, O, O, X, O]
  [X, X, O, O, X, X, X, O]
  [X, X, O, O, X, X, O, X]
  [O, X, X, O, O, O, X, O]
  [X, O, X, X, X, O, X, X]
  """
}
```

For testability, we seed a `Random` object with `randomSeed` to produce identical output each time the program runs. Each element of `grid` is initialized with `Blank`. In `turn()`, we first find all cells containing `Blank`, along with their indices. If there are no more `Blank` cells then the simulation is complete. Otherwise, we use `random()` with our seeded generator to select one of the `Blank` cells. Because we used `withIndex()` earlier, we must select the `index` property to produce the location of the cell we want to change.

To display the `List` in the form of a two-dimensional grid, `toString()` uses the `chunked()` library function to break the `List` into pieces, each of length `side`, then joins these together with newlines.

Try experimenting with `FillIt` using different `side`s and `randomSeed`s.
