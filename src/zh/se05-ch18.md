# Companion Objects

> Member functions act on particular instances of a class. Some functions aren’t “about” an object, so they don’t need to be tied to that object.

Functions and fields inside `companion object`s are about the class. Regular class elements can access the elements of the companion object, but the companion object elements cannot access the regular class elements.

As you saw in [Objects](javascript:void(0)), it’s possible to define a regular `object` inside a class, but that doesn’t provide an association between the `object` and the class. In particular, you’re forced to explicitly name the nested `object` when you refer to its members. If you define a companion object inside a class, its elements become transparently available to that class:

```
// CompanionObjects/CompanionObject.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.eq

class WithCompanion {
  companion object {
    val i = 3
    fun f() = i * 3
  }
  fun g() = i + f()
}

fun WithCompanion.Companion.h() = f() * i

fun main() {
  val wc = WithCompanion()
  wc.g() eq 12
  WithCompanion.i eq 3
  WithCompanion.f() eq 9
  WithCompanion.h() eq 27
}
```

Outside the class, you access members of the companion object using the class name, as in `WithCompanion.i` and `WithCompanion.f()`. Other members of the class can access the companion object elements without qualification, as you see in the definition of `g()`.

`h()` is an extension function to the companion object.

If a function doesn’t require access to private class members, you can choose to define it at file scope rather than putting it in a companion object.

Only one companion object is allowed per class. For clarity, you can give the companion object a name:

```
// CompanionObjects/NamingCompanionObjects.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.eq

class WithNamed {
  companion object Named {
    fun s() = "from Named"
  }
}

class WithDefault {
  companion object {
    fun s() = "from Default"
  }
}

fun main() {
  WithNamed.s() eq "from Named"
  WithNamed.Named.s() eq "from Named"
  WithDefault.s() eq "from Default"
  // The default name is "Companion":
  WithDefault.Companion.s() eq "from Default"
}
```

Even when you name the companion object you can still access its elements without using the name. If you don’t give the companion object a name, Kotlin assigns it the name `Companion`.

If you create a property inside a companion object, it produces a single piece of storage for that field, shared with all instances of the associated class:

```
// CompanionObjects/ObjectProperty.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.eq

class WithObjectProperty {
  companion object {
    private var n: Int = 0 // Only one
  }
  fun increment() = ++n
}

fun main() {
  val a = WithObjectProperty()
  val b = WithObjectProperty()
  a.increment() eq 1
  b.increment() eq 2
  a.increment() eq 3
}
```

The tests in `main()` show that `n` has only a single piece of storage, no matter how many instances of `WithObjectProperty` are created. `a` and `b` both access the same memory for `n`.

`increment()` shows that you can access `private` members of the `companion object` from its surrounding class.

When a function is *only* accessing properties in the companion object, it makes sense to move that function inside the companion object:

```
// CompanionObjects/ObjectFunctions.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.eq

class CompanionObjectFunction {
  companion object {
    private var n: Int = 0
    fun increment() = ++n
  }
}

fun main() {
  CompanionObjectFunction.increment() eq 1
  CompanionObjectFunction.increment() eq 2
}
```

You no longer need a `CompanionObjectFunction` instance to call `increment()`.

Suppose you’d like to keep a count of every object you create, to give each one a unique readable identifier:

```
// CompanionObjects/ObjectCounter.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.eq

class Counted {
  companion object {
    private var count = 0
  }
  private val id = count++
  override fun toString() = "#$id"
}

fun main() {
  List(4) { Counted() } eq "[#0, #1, #2, #3]"
}
```

A companion object can be an instance of a class defined elsewhere:

```
// CompanionObjects/CompanionInstance.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.*

interface ZI {
  fun f(): String
  fun g(): String
}

open class ZIOpen : ZI {
  override fun f() = "ZIOpen.f()"
  override fun g() = "ZIOpen.g()"
}

class ZICompanion {
  companion object: ZIOpen()
  fun u() = trace("${f()} ${g()}")
}

class ZICompanionInheritance {
  companion object: ZIOpen() {
    override fun g() =
      "ZICompanionInheritance.g()"
    fun h() = "ZICompanionInheritance.h()"
  }
  fun u() = trace("${f()} ${g()} ${h()}")
}

class ZIClass {
  companion object: ZI {
    override fun f() = "ZIClass.f()"
    override fun g() = "ZIClass.g()"
  }
  fun u() = trace("${f()} ${g()}")
}

fun main() {
  ZIClass.f()
  ZIClass.g()
  ZIClass().u()
  ZICompanion.f()
  ZICompanion.g()
  ZICompanion().u()
  ZICompanionInheritance.f()
  ZICompanionInheritance.g()
  ZICompanionInheritance().u()
  trace eq """
    ZIClass.f() ZIClass.g()
    ZIOpen.f() ZIOpen.g()
    ZIOpen.f()
    ZICompanionInheritance.g()
    ZICompanionInheritance.h()
  """
}
```

`ZICompanion` uses a `ZIOpen` object as its companion object, and `ZICompanionInheritance` creates a `ZIOpen` object *while* overriding and extending `ZIOpen`. `ZIClass` shows that you can implement an interface while creating the companion object.

If the class you want to use as a companion object is not `open`, you cannot use it directly as we did above. However, if that class implements an interface you can still use it via [Class Delegation](javascript:void(0)):

```
// CompanionObjects/CompanionDelegation.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.*

class ZIClosed : ZI {
  override fun f() = "ZIClosed.f()"
  override fun g() = "ZIClosed.g()"
}

class ZIDelegation {
  companion object: ZI by ZIClosed()
  fun u() = trace("${f()} ${g()}")
}

class ZIDelegationInheritance {
  companion object: ZI by ZIClosed() {
    override fun g() =
      "ZIDelegationInheritance.g()"
    fun h() =
      "ZIDelegationInheritance.h()"
  }
  fun u() = trace("${f()} ${g()} ${h()}")
}

fun main() {
  ZIDelegation.f()
  ZIDelegation.g()
  ZIDelegation().u()
  ZIDelegationInheritance.f()
  ZIDelegationInheritance.g()
  ZIDelegationInheritance().u()
  trace eq """
    ZIClosed.f() ZIClosed.g()
    ZIClosed.f()
    ZIDelegationInheritance.g()
    ZIDelegationInheritance.h()
  """
}
```

`ZIDelegationInheritance` shows that you can take the non-`open` class `ZIClosed`, delegate it, then override and extend *that delegate*. Delegation forwards the methods of an interface to the instance that provides an implementation. Even if the class of that instance is `final`, we can still override and add methods to the delegation receiver.

Here’s a small brain-teaser:

```
// CompanionObjects/DelegateAndExtend.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.eq

interface Extended: ZI {
  fun u(): String
}

class Extend : ZI by Companion, Extended {
  companion object: ZI {
    override fun f() = "Extend.f()"
    override fun g() = "Extend.g()"
  }
  override fun u() = "${f()} ${g()}"
}

private fun test(e: Extended): String {
  e.f()
  e.g()
  return e.u()
}

fun main() {
  test(Extend()) eq "Extend.f() Extend.g()"
}
```

In `Extend`, the `ZI` interface is implemented using its own `companion object`, which has the default name `Companion`. But we are also implementing the `Extended` interface, which is the `ZI` interface plus an extra function `u()`. The `ZI` portion of `Extended` is already implemented, via `Companion`, so we only need to `override` the additional function `u()` to complete `Extend`. Now an `Extend` object can be upcast to `Extended` as the argument to `test()`.

A common use for a companion object is controlling object creation—this is the *Factory Method* pattern. Suppose you’d like to only allow the creation of `List`s of `Numbered2` objects, and not individual `Numbered2` objects:

```
// CompanionObjects/CompanionFactory.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.eq

class Numbered2
private constructor(private val id: Int) {
  override fun toString(): String = "#$id"
  companion object Factory {
    fun create(size: Int) =
      List(size) { Numbered2(it) }
  }
}

fun main() {
  Numbered2.create(0) eq "[]"
  Numbered2.create(5) eq
    "[#0, #1, #2, #3, #4]"
}
```

The `Numbered2` constructor is `private`. This means there’s only one way to create an instance—via the `create()` factory function. A factory function can sometimes solve problems that regular constructors cannot.

Constructors in companion objects are initialized when the enclosing class is instantiated for the first time in a program:

```
// CompanionObjects/Initialization.kt
package companionobjects
import atomictest.*

class CompanionInit {
  companion object {
    init {
      trace("Companion Constructor")
    }
  }
}

fun main() {
  trace("Before")
  CompanionInit()
  trace("After 1")
  CompanionInit()
  trace("After 2")
  CompanionInit()
  trace("After 3")
  trace eq """
    Before
    Companion Constructor
    After 1
    After 2
    After 3
  """
}
```

You can see from the output that the companion object is constructed only once, the first time a `CompanionInit()` object is created.
