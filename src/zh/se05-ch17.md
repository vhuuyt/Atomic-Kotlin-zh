# Inner Classes

> Inner classes are like nested classes, but an object of an inner class maintains a reference to the outer class.

An `inner` class has an implicit link to the outer class. In the following example, `Hotel` is like `Airport` from [Nested Classes](javascript:void(0)), but it uses `inner` classes. Note that `reception` is part of `Hotel`, but `callReception()`, which is a member of the nested class `Room`, accesses `reception` without qualification:

```
// InnerClasses/Hotel.kt
package innerclasses
import atomictest.eq

class Hotel(private val reception: String) {
  open inner class Room(val id: Int = 0) {
    // Uses 'reception' from outer class:
    fun callReception() =
      "Room $id Calling $reception"
  }
  private inner class Closet : Room()
  fun closet(): Room = Closet()
}

fun main() {
  val nycHotel = Hotel("311")
  // You need an outer object to
  // create an instance of the inner class:
  val room = nycHotel.Room(319)
  room.callReception() eq
    "Room 319 Calling 311"
  val sfHotel = Hotel("0")
  val closet = sfHotel.closet()
  closet.callReception() eq "Room 0 Calling 0"
}
```

Because `Closet` inherits the inner class `Room`, `Closet` must also be an `inner` class. Nested classes cannot inherit from `inner` classes.

`Closet` is `private`, so it is only visible within the scope of `Hotel`.

An `inner` object keeps a reference to its associated outer object. Thus, when creating an `inner` object you must first have an outer object. You cannot create a `Room` object without a `Hotel` object, as you see with `nycHotel.Room()`.

`inner` `data` classes are not allowed.

### Qualified `this`

One of the benefits of classes is the `this` reference. You don’t have to explicitly say “the current object” when you access a property or member function.

With a simple class, the meaning of `this` is obvious, but with an `inner` class, `this` could refer to either the `inner` object or an outer object. To resolve this issue, Kotlin provides the *qualified `this`* syntax: `this` followed by `@` and the name of the target class.

Consider three levels of classes: an outer class `Fruit` containing an `inner` class `Seed`, which itself contains an `inner` class `DNA`:

```
// InnerClasses/QualifiedThis.kt
package innerclasses
import atomictest.eq
import typechecking.name

class Fruit { // Implicit label @Fruit
  fun changeColor(color: String) =
    "Fruit $color"
  fun absorbWater(amount: Int) {}
  inner class Seed { // Implicit label @Seed
    fun changeColor(color: String) =
      "Seed $color"
    fun germinate() {}
    fun whichThis() {
      // Defaults to the current class:
      this.name eq "Seed"
      // To clarify, you can redundantly
      // qualify the default this:
      this@Seed.name  eq "Seed"
      // Must explicitly access Fruit:
      this@Fruit.name  eq "Fruit"
      // Cannot access a further-inner class:
      // this@DNA.name
    }
    inner class DNA { // Implicit label @DNA
      fun changeColor(color: String) {
        // changeColor(color) // Recursive
        this@Seed.changeColor(color)
        this@Fruit.changeColor(color)
      }
      fun plant() {
        // Call outer-class functions
        // Without qualification:
        germinate()
        absorbWater(10)
      }
      // Extension function:
      fun Int.grow() { // Implicit label @grow
        // Default is the Int.grow() receiver:
        this.name eq "Int"
        // Redundant qualification:
        this@grow.name  eq "Int"
        // You can still access everything:
        this@DNA.name  eq "DNA"
        this@Seed.name  eq "Seed"
        this@Fruit.name  eq "Fruit"
      }
      // Extension functions on outer classes:
      fun Seed.plant() {}
      fun Fruit.plant() {}
      fun whichThis() {
        // Defaults to the current class:
        this.name eq "DNA"
        // Redundant qualification:
        this@DNA.name  eq "DNA"
        // The others must be explicit:
        this@Seed.name  eq "Seed"
        this@Fruit.name  eq "Fruit"
      }
    }
  }
}

// Extension function:
fun Fruit.grow(amount: Int) {
  absorbWater(amount)
  // Calls Fruit's version of changeColor():
  changeColor("Red") eq "Fruit Red"
}

// Inner-class extension function:
fun Fruit.Seed.grow(n: Int) {
  germinate()
  // Calls Seed's version of changeColor():
  changeColor("Green") eq "Seed Green"
}

// Inner-class extension function:
fun Fruit.Seed.DNA.grow(n: Int) = n.grow()

fun main() {
  val fruit = Fruit()
  fruit.grow(4)
  val seed = fruit.Seed()
  seed.grow(9)
  seed.whichThis()
  val dna = seed.DNA()
  dna.plant()
  dna.grow(5)
  dna.whichThis()
  dna.changeColor("Purple")
}
```

`Fruit`, `Seed` and `DNA` all have functions called `changeColor()`, but there’s no overriding—this is not an inheritance relationship. Because they have the same name and signature, the only way to distinguish them is with a qualified `this`, as you see in `DNA`’s `changeColor()`. Inside `plant()`, functions in either of the two outer classes can be called without qualification if there are no name collisions.

Even though it’s an extension function, `grow()` can still access all the objects in the outer class. `grow()` can be called anywhere the `Fruit.Seed.DNA` implicit receiver is available; for example, inside an extension function for `DNA`.

### Inner Class Inheritance

An inner class can inherit another inner class from a *different* outer class. Here, `Yolk` in `BigEgg` is derived from `Yolk` in `Egg`:

```
// InnerClasses/InnerClassInheritance.kt
package innerclasses
import atomictest.*

open class Egg {
  private var yolk = Yolk()
  open inner class Yolk {
    init { trace("Egg.Yolk()") }
    open fun f() { trace("Egg.Yolk.f()") }
  }
  init { trace("New Egg()") }
  fun insertYolk(y: Yolk) { yolk = y }
  fun g() { yolk.f() }
}

class BigEgg : Egg() {
  inner class Yolk : Egg.Yolk() {
    init { trace("BigEgg.Yolk()") }
    override fun f() {
      trace("BigEgg.Yolk.f()")
    }
  }
  init { insertYolk(Yolk()) }
}

fun main() {
  BigEgg().g()
  trace eq """
    Egg.Yolk()
    New Egg()
    Egg.Yolk()
    BigEgg.Yolk()
    BigEgg.Yolk.f()
  """
}
```

`BigEgg.Yolk` explicitly names `Egg.Yolk` as its base class, and overrides its `f()` member function. The function `insertYolk()` allows `BigEgg` to upcast one of its own `Yolk` objects into the `yolk` reference in `Egg`, so when `g()` calls `yolk.f()`, the overridden version of `f()` is used. The second call to `Egg.Yolk()` is the base-class constructor call of the `BigEgg.Yolk` constructor. You can see that the overridden version of `f()` is used when `g()` is called.

As a review of object construction, study the `trace` output until it makes sense.

### Local & Anonymous Inner Classes

Classes defined inside member functions are called *local inner classes*. These can also be created anonymously, using an *object expression*, or using a [SAM conversion](javascript:void(0)). In all cases, the `inner` keyword is not used, but is implied:

```
// InnerClasses/LocalInnerClasses.kt
package innerclasses
import atomictest.eq

fun interface Pet {
  fun speak(): String
}

object CreatePet {
  fun home() = " home!"
  fun dog(): Pet {
    val say = "Bark"
    // Local inner class:
    class Dog : Pet {
      override fun speak() = say + home()
    }
    return Dog()
  }
  fun cat(): Pet {
    val emit = "Meow"
    // Anonymous inner class:
    return object: Pet {
      override fun speak() = emit + home()
    }
  }
  fun hamster(): Pet {
    val squeak = "Squeak"
    // SAM conversion:
    return Pet { squeak + home() }
  }
}

fun main() {
  CreatePet.dog().speak() eq "Bark home!"
  CreatePet.cat().speak() eq "Meow home!"
  CreatePet.hamster().speak() eq "Squeak home!"
}
```

A local inner class has access to other elements in the function as well as elements in the outer-class object, thus `say`, `emit`, `squeak` and `home()` are available within `speak()`.

You can identify an anonymous inner class because it uses an object expression, which you see in `cat()`. It returns an `object` of a class inherited from `Pet` that overrides `speak()`. Anonymous inner classes are smaller and more straightforward and do not create a named class that will only be used in one place. Even more compact is a [SAM conversion](javascript:void(0)), as seen in `hamster()`.

Because inner classes keep a reference to the outer-class object, local inner classes can access all members of the enclosing class:

```
// InnerClasses/CounterFactory.kt
package innerclasses
import atomictest.*

fun interface Counter {
  fun next(): Int
}

object CounterFactory {
  private var count = 0
  fun new(name: String): Counter {
    // Local inner class:
    class Local : Counter {
      init { trace("Local()") }
      override fun next(): Int {
        // Access local identifiers:
        trace("$name $count")
        return count++
      }
    }
    return Local()
  }
  fun new2(name: String): Counter {
    // Instance of an anonymous inner class:
    return object: Counter {
      init { trace("Counter()") }
      override fun next(): Int {
        trace("$name $count")
        return count++
      }
    }
  }
  fun new3(name: String): Counter {
    trace("Counter()")
    return Counter { // SAM conversion
      trace("$name $count")
      count++
    }
  }
}

fun main() {
  fun test(counter: Counter) {
    (0..3).forEach { counter.next() }
  }
  test(CounterFactory.new("Local"))
  test(CounterFactory.new2("Anon"))
  test(CounterFactory.new3("SAM"))
  trace eq """
    Local() Local 0 Local 1 Local 2 Local 3
    Counter() Anon 4 Anon 5 Anon 6 Anon 7
    Counter() SAM 8 SAM 9 SAM 10 SAM 11
  """
}
```

A `Counter` keeps track of a `count` and returns the next `Int` value. `new()`, `new2()` and `new3()` each create a different implementation of the `Counter` interface. `new()` returns an instance of a named inner class, `new2()` returns an instance of an anonymous inner class, and `new3()` uses a [SAM conversion](javascript:void(0)) to create an anonymous object. All the resulting `Counter` objects have implicit access to the elements of the outer object, thus they are inner classes and not just nested classes. You can see from the output that `count` in `CounterFactory` is shared by all `Counter` objects.

SAM conversions are limited—for example, they do not support `init` clauses.

In Kotlin, files can contain multiple top-level classes and functions. Because of this, there’s rarely a need for local classes, so if you do need them they should be basic and straightforward. For example, it’s reasonable to create a simple `data` class that’s only used inside a function. If a local class becomes complex, you should probably take it out of the function and make it a regular class.
